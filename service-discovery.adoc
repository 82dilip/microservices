# Service Registration and Discovery

Microservices architecture require a significant amount of investment in `NoOps' or http://blogs.gartner.com/gary-olliffe/2015/01/30/microservices-guts-on-the-outside/[Outer Architecture]. One of the key components of that is service registration and discovery. Multiple microservices are composed to create an application and each microservice can scale independently. Exact location or URI of the service may not be known until its deployed, especially if its deployed in a PaaS or using Containers.

_Service registration_ allows each microservice to bind a physical URI to a logical name. This logical name can then be used during _service discovery_ to discover, and then invoke, the microservice. Multiple URIs may be registered under the same logical name and thus a load balancing may be provided, possibly metrics-driven, to distribute the requests amongst multiple microservices.

There are multiple tools used for service registry and discovery. This document will highlight how to use them from a Java application.

## ZooKeeper

Curator

## Consul

consul-registrar, consul-template
