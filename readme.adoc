# Refactor monolith to microservices

This workspace will show how to refactor a Java EE monolith to a
microservices-based application. This will be accomplished in multiple
phases:

. Phase 1: Functional decomposition of a `WAR` into multiple `WAR`s. Use hardcoded service URIs.
. Phase 2: Use service registration and discovery
. Phase 3: Continuous integration
. Phase 4: Continuous deployment
. Phase 5: Proactive monitoring and scale in/out
. Phase 6: Change the implementation stack of a service

Operational concerns are addressed in the following documents:

. Continuous Integration
. Continuous Deployment
